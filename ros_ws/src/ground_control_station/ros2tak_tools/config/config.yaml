# Configuration for the Basestation Syetem interacting ROS and TAK server. 

# Preliminary: 
# Tak-server: Server that receives CoT messages and sends them to the TAK clients (e.g., ATAK, WinTAK, etc.)
# COT (Cursor on Target) message: A message format used by TAK clients to share location and other information with/without Tak-server.

# Instructions: 
# (1) Please read the comments in the configuration file to understand the configuration parameters.
# (2) The confguration key names are case-sensitive. Please use the same key names as mentioned in the comments.
