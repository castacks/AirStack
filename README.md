AirStack is a comprehensive, modular autonomy stack for embodied AI and robotics developed by the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org) at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. It provides a complete framework for developing, testing, and deploying autonomous mobile systems in both simulated and real-world environments.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily swap out components to customize for your specific needs
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Built on ROS 2 for robust inter-process communication
- **Simulation Support**: Integrated with NVIDIA Isaac Sim for high-fidelity simulation
- **Multi-Robot Capability**: Control and coordinate multiple robots simultaneously
- **Ground Control Station**: Monitor and control robots through an intuitive interface
- **Comprehensive Autonomy Stack**:
  - Robot Interface Layer
  - Sensor Integration
  - Perception Systems
  - Local Planning & Control
  - Global Planning
  - Behavior Management

## 📋 System Requirements

- **Docker**: With NVIDIA Container Toolkit support
- **NVIDIA GPU**: RTX 3070 or better (for local Isaac Sim)
- **Storage**: At least 25GB free space for Docker images
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 recommended

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --recursive -j8 git@github.com:castacks/AirStack.git
cd AirStack
```

### 2. Install Docker with NVIDIA Support

Follow [NVIDIA's instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment/vmware/latest/docker.html) for installing Docker with NVIDIA GPU support. Make sure `docker-compose-plugin` is also installed.

### 3. Configure the Repository

```bash
./configure.sh
```

Follow the prompts to complete the initial configuration.

### 4. Get the Docker Images

#### Option 1: Pull from AirLab Registry (Preferred)

```bash
docker login airlab-storage.andrew.cmu.edu:5001
# Enter your andrew id (without @andrew.cmu.edu)
# Enter your andrew password

# Pull the images in the docker compose file
docker compose pull
```

#### Option 2: Build Docker Images From Scratch

```bash
# Download the Ascent Spirit SITL software package
bash simulation/isaac-sim/installation/download_sitl.bash

# Build the images locally (requires NVIDIA NGC access)
docker compose build
```

### 5. Launch the System

```bash
xhost +  # allow docker access to X-Server

# Start docker compose services
docker compose up -d
# For multiple robots: docker compose up -d --scale robot=3
```

This will automatically launch and play the Isaac Sim scene specified in the `.env` file.

### 6. Control the Robot

Find the RQT GUI window:
1. Click "Arm and Takeoff"
2. Click "Global Plan" in the trajectory window

You can also switch to "Fixed Trajectory" mode and click "Publish" to follow a predefined trajectory.

### 7. Shutdown

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AirStack follows a layered architecture approach:

```
Robot
├── Interface Layer: Communication with robot controllers
├── Sensors Layer: Data acquisition from various sensors
├── Perception Layer: State estimation and environment understanding
├── Local Layer: 
│   ├── World Model: Local environment representation
│   ├── Planning: Trajectory generation and obstacle avoidance
│   └── Controls: Trajectory following
├── Global Layer:
│   ├── World Model: Global environment mapping
│   └── Planning: Mission-level path planning
└── Behavior Layer: High-level decision making
```
