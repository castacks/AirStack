Isaac Sim follows the Forward-Left-Up (FLU) coordinate system. This means that the X-axis points forward, the Y-axis points left, and the Z-axis points up. This is the same convention used in the Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim's parent platform, Omniverse. [Isaac Docs](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/reference_conventions.html)
