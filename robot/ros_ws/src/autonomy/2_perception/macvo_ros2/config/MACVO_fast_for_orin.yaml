# MAC-VO Fast Mode (Jun 2025 Update)
#   Comparing to the Performant mode (MACVO_Performant), the Fast Mode uses 
#   mixed-precision inference of fp32, fp16 and bf16. The fast mode can run
#   at 12.5fps on 480x640 images on RTX Ada 6000 GPU, almost twice the speed
#   as Performant Mode.
#   
#   If minor degrade in accuracy (~5% increase in RTE and ROE) is acceptable,
#   then you should use Fast Mode for most of the time.
#
