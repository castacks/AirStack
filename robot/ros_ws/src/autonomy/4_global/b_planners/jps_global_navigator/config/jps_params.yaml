    # JPS Algorithm Parameters
    jps_max_iterations: 10000          # Maximum iterations for JPS search
    jps_goal_tolerance: 2.0            # Distance tolerance to consider goal reached (meters)
    cost_threshold: 0.9               # Cost threshold above which cells are considered obstacles
    
    # Path Smoothing Parameters
    smoothing_iterations: 5            # Number of smoothing iterations to apply
    smoothing_step_size: 0.1          # Step size for smoothing algorithm
    
    # Grid Parameters
    resolution: 0.5                    # Grid resolution in meters
    
    # Topic Configuration
    cost_map_topic: "/cost_map"        # Input cost map topic
    odom_topic: "/odom"               # Input odometry topic
    
    # Visualization
    enable_debug_visualization: true   # Enable visualization of search process
    
    # Performance Tuning
    # These parameters can be adjusted based on your specific use case:
    # - Increase jps_max_iterations for more complex environments
    # - Decrease resolution for faster planning (but less precise paths)
    # - Increase smoothing_iterations for smoother paths
    # - Adjust cost_threshold based on your cost map values
