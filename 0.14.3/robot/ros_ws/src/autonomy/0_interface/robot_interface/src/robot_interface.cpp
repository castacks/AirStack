 * @brief this file is a blank file so that we can define it as a library in the CMakeLists.txt
 * file. theoretically we should use the add_library(robot_interface INTERFACE) command in the
 * CMakeLists.txt file, but haven't figured out how to make it work with ament_target_dependencies()
 * yet
 * @version 0.1
