## Overview

Welcome to `kit-app-template`, an essential toolkit for developers diving into GPU-accelerated application development within the NVIDIA Omniverse ecosystem. This repository provides streamlined templates and tools designed to simplify the creation of high-performance OpenUSD-based applications powered by the Omniverse Kit SDK.


### About Omniverse Kit SDK

The Omniverse Kit SDK empowers developers to build immersive 3D applications with ease. Key features include:
- **Language Support:** Develop in Python or C++, offering flexibility and power to a wide range of developers.
- **OpenUSD Foundation:** Utilize Open Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) for creating, manipulating, and rendering rich 3D content.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Leverage GPU-accelerated capabilities for high-fidelity visualization and simulation.
- **Extensibility:**  Easily build specialized Extensions that provide dynamic user interfaces, integration with various systems, and provide direct control over OpenUSD data, making it versatile for numerous applications.

### Applications and Use Cases

The kit-app-template enables developers to create cross-platform (Windows and Linux) accelerated applications, equipped with tooling to streamline packaging for easier deployment. This covers a broad range of use cases, from simulating real-world systems to generating photorealistic synthetic data for AI training. Whether your focus is on creating engaging virtual worlds, developing tools for data analysis, or crafting simulations, the combination of this repository and the Kit SDK provides the foundation you need.

### A Deeper Understanding

The `kit-app-template` repository is designed to abstract complexity, jumpstarting your development with pre-configured templates, tools, and essential boilerplate. For those seeking a deeper understanding of the application and extension creation process, we've provided a companion tutorial. **[Explore the tutorial here](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-app-template/latest/docs/intro.html)**â€”it offers detailed insights into the underlying structure and mechanisms, enabling a thorough grasp of both Kit and the development process.

## Quick Start

This section guides you through creating your first Kit SDK-based Application using the `kit-app-template` repository. For a more comprehensive explanation of functionality previewed here, reference the following [Tutorial](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-app-template/latest/docs/intro.html) for an in-depth exploration.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the `kit-app-template` to your local workspace:

#### 1a. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template.git
```

#### 1b. Navigate to Cloned Directory

```bash
cd kit-app-template
```

### 2. Create and Configure New Application From Template

Run the following command to initiate the configuration wizard:

**Linux:**
```bash
./repo.sh template new
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\repo.bat template new
```

> **Note:** If this is your first time running the `template new` tool, you'll be prompted to accept the Omniverse Licensing Terms.

Follow the prompt instructions:
- **? Select with arrow keys what you want to create:** Application
- **? Select with arrow keys your desired template:** Kit Base Editor
- **? Enter name of application .kit file [name-spaced, lowercase, alphanumeric]:** [set application name]
- **? Enter application_display_name:** [set application display name]
- **? Enter version:**: [set application version]


### 3. Build

Build your new application with the following command:


**Linux:**
```bash
./repo.sh build
```
**Windows:**
```powershell
.\repo.bat build
 ```

 If you experience issues related to build, please see the [Usage and Troubleshooting](readme-assets/additional-docs/usage_and_troubleshooting.md) section for additional information.


### 4. Launch

Initiate your newly created application using:

**Linux:**
```bash
./repo.sh launch
```
**Windows:**
```powershell
.\repo.bat launch
```

**? Select with arrow keys which App would you like to launch:** [Select the created editor application]

***NOTE:* The initial startup may take 5 to 8 minutes as shaders compile for the first time. After initial shader compilation, startup time will reduce dramatically**


## Templates

`kit-app-template` features an array of configurable templates for `Extensions` and `Applications`, catering to a range of desired development starting points from minimal to feature rich.

- **[USD Explorer](./templates/apps/usd_explorer)**: A full featured application for managing, collaborating on, and exploring large Open USD scenes.

### Extensions

Enhance Omniverse capabilities with extension templates:

- **[Basic Python](./templates/extensions/basic_python)**: The minimal definition of an Omniverse Python Extension.

- **[Basic C++](./templates/extensions/basic_cpp)**: The minimal definition of an Omniverse C++ Extension.

- **[Python UI](./templates/extensions/python_ui)**: An extension that provides an easily extendable Python-based user interface.

## Tools

The `kit-app-template` includes a suite of tools to aid in the development, testing, and deployment of your projects. A brief overview of some key tools:

- **Help (`./repo.sh -h` or `.\repo.bat -h`):** Provides a list of available tools and their descriptions.

- **Template Creation (`./repo.sh template` or `.\repo.bat template`):** Assists in starting a new project by generating a scaffold from a template application or extension.

- **Build (`./repo.sh build` or `.\repo.bat build`):** Compiles your applications and extensions, preparing them for launch.

- **Launch (`./repo.sh launch`or`.\repo.bat launch`):** Starts your compiled application or extension.

- **Testing (`./repo.sh test` or `.\repo.bat test`):** Facilitates the execution of test suites for your extensions, ensuring code quality and functionality.

- **Packaging (`./repo.sh package` or `.\repo.bat package`):** Aids in packaging your application for distribution, making it easier to share or deploy in cloud environments.


For a more detailed overview of available tooling see the [Kit App Template Tooling Guide](readme-assets/additional-docs/kit_app_template_tooling_guide.md) or execute the help command specific to the tool your are interested in (e.g. `./repo.sh template -h` or `.\repo.bat template -h`).
