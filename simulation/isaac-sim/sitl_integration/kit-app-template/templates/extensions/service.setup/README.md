### Use Cases

This setup extension is well suited for:

- Developers building headless services that require Kit SDK functionalities.

### Key Features

- Sample ServiceAPIRouter setup.
- Sample endpoint to demonstrate interaction patterns within service Kit SDK and OpenUSD.

## Usage

This extension is automatically created and configured when you generate a new service application using the [Service Application Template](../../apps/kit_service/README.md).
