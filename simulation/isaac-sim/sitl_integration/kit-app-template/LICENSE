2.4 License Types.

Omniverse Products obtained by individuals from the Omniverse Website under this license may be used commercially, provided however that (a) an authorized user can only use Nucleus, Connectors, Apps and Kits without Enterprise Support with one other individual in your entity or its affiliates to create Project Content without purchasing Subscription Licenses and (b) use of Batch by an individual is limited to two GPUs. For clarity, an entity and its affiliates may have multiple groups of up to two individuals creating Project Content without purchasing Subscription Licenses. Omniverse Enterprise Subscription Licenses are required for an authorized user to use Nucleus, Connectors, Apps and Kits with three or more individuals in your entity or affiliates to create Project Content. The License Portal contains Omniverse Products available under Subscription Licenses.

Omniverse Products in the License Portal are licensed under the license types below; and not all license types may be available for each Omniverse Product. Your order, license key and/or the product description will indicate the features of your license. If a product description indicates more than one limitation, for example GPU, each such limit may not be exceeded.

“GPU” means (i) for on-premise deployments, the number of physical GPUs in the computing environment which is accessed by the Omniverse Product, or (ii) in a cloud computing environment, the number of GPUs attached to the compute instance on which the Omniverse Product is installed. For per GPU licenses, NVIDIA requires one Omniverse Product license for each GPU. For Omniverse Products that are licensed under the Agreement to run on computing environments or compute instances without an NVIDIA GPU, NVIDIA requires one Omniverse Product license for each computing environment, or compute instance.

“Named User License” means a license that may only be used by a single named authorized user and such authorized user may not re-assign or share the license with any other person (including, without limitation, other authorized users); provided, however, that if the named authorized user is no longer employed or no longer requires any access to Omniverse Product as part of his or her job, you may re-assign a named user license to a new named authorized user. You shall track the names and the access period of individuals in conjunction with the use of Named User Licenses.
