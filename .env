# This is the main .env file for AirStack, which sets DOCKER COMPOSE VARIABLES FOR VARIABLE INTERPOLATION IN docker-compose.yaml.
# These variables do NOT get set within the robot container itself. For setting container environment variables, use env_file: attribute in docker-compose.yaml.
# Standard Usage: airstack --env-file .env up

# Warning: even though this file is organized into sections, all variables get propagated to all sub-level 
#  docker-compose files, so be careful about naming conflicts.
